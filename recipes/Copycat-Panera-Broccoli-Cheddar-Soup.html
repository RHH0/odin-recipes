    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Make scrumptious mushroom rice in a casserole dish — it's as simple as can be!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>       
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups coarsely chopped broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 cup matchstick-cut carrots</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Whisk 1/4 cup melted butter and flour together in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Continue to whisk and cook, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk if necessary to keep the flour from burning, 3 to 4 minutes. </li>
        <li>Gradually add milk while whisking constantly; stir in chicken stock and bring to a simmer. </li>
        <li>Cook until mixture is thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add broccoli, carrots, celery, and sautéed onion; simmer until all the vegetables are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in Cheddar cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper to taste before serving. </li>
    </ol>
